Robot Space Wars

The basic premis. You have a base and several fleets of ships. You build up your base like many
existing games (sim city, lacuna-expanse, Vega Conflict , etc) and this allows you to create a (small)
number of fleets of ships.

You have the option to attack other bases with your fleets, you can attack other fleets, on a one
against one basis in 'manual' mode.

So far what has been described is a copy of Vega Conflict.

The 'value added' bit however is that you are able to program your fleets to carry out a
pre-programmed set of actions and carry out battles autonomously.

This pre-programmed concept should attract many people who were attracted to games such as Lacuna
Expanse and to the early computer game RobotWar (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RobotWar)

It is anticipated that a set of pre-defined scripts will be provided to carry out basic attacks.
This is similar to Vega Conflict where fleets can be attacked whilst the owner is away, in which case
they carry out a basic set of strategies (but which cannot be modified in Vega Conflict).

How people create Battle Scripts is still to be defined, but the following are options.

  * An in-built script (similar to Robot Wars) using a bespoke language.
  * Plug-ins for other languages, such a Javascript, Perl, Python, Java

Fleet to Fleet battles.

Fleets from different empires will have many opportunities to interact.

  * When attacking a 'base' you may have to defeat the fleets which are set to defend it.
  * You may want to attack a fleet which is in transit, in order to steal it's cargo
  * In Tournaments, your fleet may be competing in competition with empires of similar rank
  * You may attack an AI player fleet

In each of these interactions, if one or more of the empires who are competing is not on line
then the auto scripts take control of the fleet. These auto scripts may either be pre-built
one's (supplied by the server) or one's supplied by the empire.

If either empire is on-line they will be informed of the battle and have the opportunity to
'take command' of their fleet and control it manually.

This then allows both one-on-one interaction between players and als
